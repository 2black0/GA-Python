# Simple Genetic Algorithm on Python
This project to show the genetic algorithm process in python

Why python? cos I love it

dont love python? its your problem :P

## Requirement
```
pip install numpy
```

## Explanation of Algorithm
Flowchart of GA

### 1. Initialize Population
What is population? Population is a collection of genes

What is gen? its an individual in the population

for simple explanation, I have an example :
``` 
gen = 'Hello World!'
Population = ('Hello World!', 'Hello Wordd!', 'Hello Morth!')
````
The length of target is 12 character, so the gen will have 12 character too

Before running the algorithm we need to create new population which is a place to save a gen


gen is an individual which compare with the target



### 2. Selection

### 3. Crossover

### 4. Mutation

### 5. Evaluation

### 6. Regeneration of Population
